A simple auto generating maze level for the NES

CC65 is the development environment.
Download cc65 from: https://github.com/cc65/cc65

Neslib (originally by Shiru) is used
neslib comes from https://github.com/clbr/neslib.git

Setup:
On windows: build the game by running compile.bat

If you install cygwin, the Makefile can be used.
- Set the NES_EMU system variable to point to your NES
emulator of choice.


You must update your environment variables so that
the cc65 binary files (ca65, ld65, etc..) are in your PATH.

This project is in its extreme early stages.
